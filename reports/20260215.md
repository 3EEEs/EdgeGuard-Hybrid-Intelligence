## 1. Team Report
Some coding progress was made for integrating the cloud uploader logic. No testing has been made on it. The team was unable to meet this week due to conflicts with everyone's schedule, planning on meeting this upcoming week. 

### A. Goals from Last Week
* **Goal:** Finalize the midterm Presentation (Still has a couple slides to go)
* **Goal:** Present the midterm presentation
* **Task:** Micheal will set up the Botos3 to push a test file into the s3 bucket (we didn't do these goals last week)
* **Task:** Ethan will set up AWS account, and Integrate the S3 upload script into the motion detection loop. (we didn't do these goals last week)
* **Task** Samuel will set up a cooldown to prevent a spam of images being sent from the motion detector. (we didn't do these goals last week)
* **Task** Calvin will make jpgs save when the motion is detected, and will create an AWS Lambda trigger that runs whenever a new image hits the S3 bucket. (we didn't do these goals last week)

### B. Progress and Issues
* **Progress:** Botos3 code is ready for testing.
* **Progress:** Presented the midterm presentation.
* **Issue:** Running a bit behind schedule, should be able to get caught up this week. Midterms messed with the group.
