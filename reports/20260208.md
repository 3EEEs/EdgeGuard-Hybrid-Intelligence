## 1. Team Report
We have had meetings in class but scheduling a time all of us can meet outside has been extremely difficult. Other commitments have caught us lacking, and we have not spent as much time as we would like on this. We have not hit all of our goals

* **Task:** Micheal will set up the Botos3 to push a test file into the s3 bucket (not done)
* **Task:** Ethan will set up AWS account, and Integrate the S3 upload script into the motion detection loop. (not done)
* **Task** Samuel will set up a cooldown to prevent a spam of images being sent from the motion detector (not done)
* **Task** Calvin will make jpgs save when the motion is detected, and will create an AWS Lambda trigger that runs whenever a new image hits the S3 bucket. (not done)


### B. Progress and Issues
* **Progress:** Split up the midterm presentation
