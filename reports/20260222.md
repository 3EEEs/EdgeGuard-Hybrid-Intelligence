## 1. Team Report
Some coding progress was made for integrating the cloud uploader logic. No testing has been made on it. The team was unable to meet this week due to conflicts with everyone's schedule, planning on meeting this upcoming week. 

### A. Goals from Last Week
* **Goal:** Split the work up for the project milestone 4 and have everyone complete their sections
* **Goal:** Code completed and ready for testing
* **Task:** Michael will work on documentation and help the others get caught up. 
* **Task:** Ethan will set up AWS account, and Integrate the S3 upload script into the motion detection loop. (we didn't do these goals last week)
* **Task** Samuel will set up a cooldown to prevent a spam of images being sent from the motion detector. (we didn't do these goals last week)
* **Task** Calvin will make jpgs save when the motion is detected, and will create an AWS Lambda trigger that runs whenever a new image hits the S3 bucket. (we didn't do these goals last week)

### B. Progress and Issues
* **Progress:** Made a cooldown timer
* **Progress:** Amazon S3 activates lmabda which sents the image from S3 to Amazon Rekognition which results in an abundance of information.
* **Issue:** Amazon Rekognition doesn't just give us the thing that takes up the most space, but it gives results about every identifiable thing in the 
* **Issue:** We need to figure out the best way to find the key character of the movement
* **Issue:** we need to find a way to find what frame is the best to send to Amazon

### C. Plans and Goals for Next Week

* **Goal:** Make the project deployable
* **Goal:** Code completed and ready for testing
* **Goal:** Project Milestone 5 tests are ready to go
